## 📌 Project Overview
The goal was to explore the official Bootstrap 5 documentation, understand its components,  
and build **three fully responsive pages** by remixing Bootstrap UI elements.

This website contains:
- **Home Page (index.html)**
- **About Page (about.html)**
- **Contact Page (contact.html)**

All pages are made using **pure Bootstrap 5 (via CDN)** with clean structure and modern layout.

## 🎯 What I Did Step-by-Step
1. Explored Bootstrap documentation: Navbars, Cards, Hero, Forms, and Layout system.  
2. Selected reusable components from Bootstrap Examples.  
3. Designed a **custom hero section** and **feature cards** for the Home page.  
4. Created **About page** with modern service cards.  
5. Built **Contact page** with Bootstrap form fields (Name, Email, Message).  
6. Ensured responsiveness across mobile, tablet, desktop using Bootstrap Grid.  
7. Uploaded files to a GitHub repository.  
8. Deployed the project using **GitHub Pages**.

## 🤖 Did I Use AI Tools?
Yes — I used:
- **Bootstrap official docs**  
- **ChatGPT** for guidance on layout ideas & writing documentation  
All components were manually customized and assembled to form original designs.
